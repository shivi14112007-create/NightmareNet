"""Certified robustness verification via randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019).

Wraps a base classifier with Gaussian noise sampled in *embedding space* (not token
space) to produce a smoothed classifier with a provable certified L2 radius: for a given
input, no perturbation with embedding-space L2 norm below the certified radius can change
the smoothed classifier's prediction.

This module is a formal complement to NightmareNet's existing empirical robustness_score
(see nightmarenet/evaluation/metrics.py). robustness_score measures how gracefully the
model degrades under specific distortions actually tried; certification here answers a
different question: for THIS input, what radius is provably safe against *any*
perturbation an adversary might choose (within the noise model), not just the ones tested?

Design note -- embedding-space vs. token-space noise:
Randomized smoothing (Cohen et al. 2019) was developed for continuous input domains
(images), where Gaussian noise is added directly to pixel values. Text is discrete --
there's no well-defined way to add continuous noise to token IDs. Following the standard
NLP adaptation, noise is instead injected into the model's continuous embedding vectors,
via a forward hook on `model.get_input_embeddings()`, and the certified radius is
therefore a radius in embedding space, not token/edit-distance space. This is a
meaningfully different guarantee than the vision-domain radius and must be surfaced as
such wherever certified radii are reported downstream (see format_results.py, sub-PR 3).

Statistical note -- two-stage CERTIFY:
Following Cohen et al.'s original procedure, certify_sample uses two *independent*
sample batches: a small n0 to select a candidate class, and a separate n to estimate its
probability. Reusing the same samples for both selection and the confidence bound would
bias the bound upward (the class is chosen *because* it had the most votes in that batch),
understating the true uncertainty -- keeping the batches independent is what makes the
reported (1 - alpha) confidence level valid.

Scope: only randomized smoothing is implemented here. Interval bound propagation (IBP)
is explicitly out of scope -- see parent issue #153. This module has no dependency on
evaluator.py or the config system -- it is standalone.

      1. Selection: draw n0 noisy embedding-space copies, take the plurality-vote class
         as the candidate prediction c_A. This stage is *not* used in the statistical
         bound below -- only to pick which class to test.

    Keeping the two stages independent (fresh noise for each) is what makes the bound

        n0: Number of selection-stage samples, independent of `n`. Cheap relative to `n`
            since it only needs to pick a candidate class, not bound its probability.

            preserved as long as possible (it's cheap and needed just to pick a candidate
            class); n is reduced first. If the budget doesn't even cover n0, n0 itself is
