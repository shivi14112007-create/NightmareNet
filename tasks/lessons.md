# NightmareNet — Lessons Learned

_(Updated after each correction or mistake)_

## Workflow Orchestration Rules

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update tasks/lessons.md with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
- Plan First: Write plan to tasks/todo.md with checkable items
- Verify Plan: Check in before starting implementation
- Track Progress: Mark items complete as you go
- Explain Changes: High-level summary at each step
- Document Results: Add review section to tasks/todo.md
- Capture Lessons: Update tasks/lessons.md after corrections

## Core Principles
- Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- Minimal Impact: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

---

## Phase 1
- `from __future__ import annotations` breaks FastAPI's `Body(...)` parameter resolution with Pydantic v2. Remove it from API modules and use `Optional[]` instead.
- When adding `Request` as first param for slowapi, rename body params to avoid shadowing (`request` → `body`) and add explicit `Body(...)` annotation.

## Phase 2
- HuggingFace `IterableDataset` does not support `len()`, `.select()`, or `.train_test_split()`. Use `.take()`, `.filter()`, and `.with_format("torch")` instead.
- For streaming tokenization, use `dataset.column_names` which may be `None` for some IterableDatasets — provide fallback list.

## Phase 3
- Model type dispatch (`causal_lm`/`masked_lm`/`seq_classification`) should be isolated to the Trainer init, not threaded through every phase, since phases only care about loss computation which the model handles internally.
- Learned adversarial generator should gracefully fallback when model unavailable — test with nonexistent model name to verify fallback path.

## Verification Audit
- CLI flags that modify config are not automatically wired end-to-end. Always trace from argparse → config mutation → object construction → usage. The `--tracker` flag in `evaluate.py` modified `config["tracking"]` but never created a tracker or passed it to `Evaluator`.
- Script files (`scripts/*.py`) should use the same dispatch/factory patterns as the library code. `evaluate.py` hardcoded `AutoModelForCausalLM` instead of using the `_MODEL_TYPE_MAP` already defined in `trainer.py`.

## Phase 4 — Remaining Improvements
- Early stopping needs separate counters for epoch adjustment vs. halt. The `AdaptiveScheduler` uses `_no_improvement_count` for epoch scaling and `_es_no_improvement` for stopping — merging them causes conflicting behavior.
- `mock.patch` path must match where the import is resolved, not where it's defined. `load_dataset` imported inside a function body in `glue.py` needs `@patch("datasets.load_dataset")` not `@patch("nightmarenet.evaluation.glue.load_dataset")`.
- Distributed wrappers must be no-ops when the library is absent. Always gate on `_ACCELERATE_AVAILABLE` and fall back to single-device semantics silently.
- Type union syntax `str | torch.device` requires Python 3.10+ at runtime but works under `from __future__ import annotations`. Verify CI matrix includes 3.9.

## Phase 5 — PR Review Fixes & Hardening
- `SlowAPIMiddleware` must be explicitly registered via `app.add_middleware(SlowAPIMiddleware)` — creating a `Limiter` and attaching it to `app.state` is NOT enough. Without the middleware, decorators are no-ops.
- CORS `allow_origins` must be stripped of whitespace. `"http://a.com , http://b.com".split(",")` yields `[" http://a.com ", " http://b.com "]` which won't match any origin header.
- In DDP training, ALL I/O operations (tokenizer save, history save, tracker.finish) that aren't model weights must be gated behind `dist_ctx.is_main_process`. Only model saving should use `dist_ctx.save_model()` (which handles sharding internally).
- Experiment trackers (wandb, tensorboard) must only be initialized on the main process. Non-main processes should get a no-op tracker to avoid duplicate runs/conflicts.
- Ruff line-length=100 must be checked before every commit. Long dict comprehensions and function signatures are the most common violators — extract helpers or wrap to multi-line.
- Hardcoded counts (like `tests_passing=159`) become immediately stale. Either compute dynamically or make optional.

## Phase 6 — Full Lint Cleanup
- Ruff's `select` key at `[tool.ruff]` top-level is deprecated. Use `[tool.ruff.lint]` section with `select` and `ignore` keys.
- UP007 (`Union[X, Y]` → `X | Y`) and UP045 (`Optional[X]` → `X | None`) must be ignored when targeting Python 3.9. Add them to `[tool.ruff.lint] ignore`.
- `ruff check --fix` for I001/F401 is reliable. Always auto-fix import sorting and unused imports first, then handle manual fixes.
- UP035 auto-fix (`typing.Iterator` → `collections.abc.Iterator`) can break I001 import ordering. Always run I001 fix again after UP035.
- B904: In FastAPI exception handlers, use `from e` for 4xx (preserves cause for debugging) and `from None` for 5xx (hides internals after logging).
- B008: FastAPI `Body(...)` in function defaults triggers B008. Move to module-level singletons like `_DISTORTION_BODY = Body(...)`.
- B023: Lambda inside a loop that captures a loop variable is a classic Python closure bug. Fix with default argument: `lambda x, _s=strength: ...`.
- E721: Use `is` instead of `==` for type comparisons (`expected_type is float`, not `expected_type == float`).
- N812: `import torch.nn.functional as F` is industry convention but violates N812. Use `# noqa: N812` rather than renaming.

## Phase 7 — Production Polish & User-Facing Integrity
- Broken internal anchor links (`#compare`) after renaming sections are invisible to the build step but break the user experience. Always grep for old section IDs after renaming.
- Static model data (layers, params) shared across multiple model types gives the ILLUSION of interactive UI. If buttons switch model type, the data MUST change — wire state to data or remove the buttons.
- Never show `pip install <pkg>` in docs/quickstart unless the package is actually published on PyPI. Use `git clone` + `pip install -e .` for local-only packages.
- Status health probes that send real distortion payloads ("ping" with strength=0.5) produce misleadingly high latency. Use minimal single-character text ("a") at minimum strength.
- Upload endpoints in status checks must send actual file data (FormData with a file blob), not empty POST bodies, or they'll fail silently.
- Every user-reachable button that appears interactive MUST do something meaningful. "Use in Comparison Lab" → dead link, model type buttons → no visual change = broken trust.
- Lucide React doesn't have brand icons (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.). Use inline SVGs for social brand icons.
- Mypy strictly enforces Starlette `add_middleware` type constraints starting in newer FastAPI versions (expecting `_MiddlewareFactory`). Subclasses like `SlowAPIMiddleware` trigger `[arg-type]` mismatch errors. Fix by appending `# type: ignore[arg-type]` to the registration call rather than trying to satisfy the internal factory protocol.

## 2026-05-27 — Tautological Docker HEALTHCHECK

**Mistake:** `docker/Dockerfile.worker` HEALTHCHECK was `python -c "import os, sys; sys.exit(0 if os.environ.get('NIGHTMARENET_REDIS_URL') else 1)"` — but the same Dockerfile sets `NIGHTMARENET_REDIS_URL` unconditionally as an `ENV` directive. The check therefore always exits 0, regardless of broker reachability, Celery worker liveness, or fallback-loop state. Docker / Compose orchestrators would never restart a broken worker.

**Why it happened:** Wrote a quick probe based on the env var being a proxy for "is the service configured?" without recognising that the same Dockerfile defines that env var as a build-time constant. The check passed reviewer eyes because reading just the `HEALTHCHECK` line in isolation made it look reasonable.

**Prevention:**
1. **A healthcheck must observe runtime state, not build-time constants.** TCP-connect, HTTP probe, query the broker, ping the worker — any signal that depends on something outside the image.
2. **Always read the full Dockerfile when reviewing a healthcheck.** Build-time `ENV`/`ARG` values are not evidence of runtime health.
3. **Add a regression test that exercises the unhealthy path.** If the test would pass with a deliberately-broken broker URL, the probe is fake.

**Future rule:** No HEALTHCHECK ships without (a) a test in `tests/` that proves it FAILS when the dependency is down, and (b) a comment in the Dockerfile explaining what runtime signal it actually checks. Build-time env vars are never sufficient.
